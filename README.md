## Overview

## ITD

The _Implementation and Test deliverable_ (ITD) provides for the implementation of a prototype of the project with related tests and documentation relating to the tests performed.

## Compile and usability

First compile the interfaces of the package adapter, which are:

* Collection
* Iterator
* List
* ListIterator
* Map
* Set

After all other files, it is important that all files are in the same folder (Source). Now you can use the adapters in your file.
