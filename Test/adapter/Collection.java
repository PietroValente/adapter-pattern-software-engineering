/**
 * <p>The root interface in the collection hierarchy. A collection represents a
 * group of objects, known as its elements. Some collections allow duplicate elements
 * and others do not. Some are ordered and others unordered. The SDK does not provide any
 * direct implementations of this interface: it provides implementations of more specific
 * subinterfaces like Set and List. This interface is typically used to pass collections
 * around and manipulate them where maximum generality is desired.
 * <p>Bags or multisets (unordered collections that may contain duplicate elements) should
 * implement this interface directly.
 * <p>All general-purpose Collection implementation classes (which typically implement
 * Collection indirectly through one of its subinterfaces) should provide two "standard"
 * constructors: a void (no arguments) constructor, which creates an empty collection, and a
 * constructor with a single argument of type Collection, which creates a new collection with the
 * same elements as its argument. In effect, the latter constructor allows the user to copy any collection,
 * producing an equivalent collection of the desired implementation type. There is no way to enforce this
 * convention (as interfaces cannot contain constructors) but all of the general-purpose Collection implementations
 * in the Java platform libraries comply.
 * <p>The "destructive" methods contained in this interface, that is, the methods that modify the collection on
 * which they operate, are specified to throw UnsupportedOperationException if this collection does not support
 * the operation. If this is the case, these methods may, but are not required to, throw an UnsupportedOperationException
 * if the invocation would have no effect on the collection. For example, invoking the addAll(Collection) method on an unmodifiable
 * collection may, but is not required to, throw the exception if the collection to be added is empty.
 * <p>Some collection implementations have restrictions on the elements that they may contain. For example, some
 * implementations prohibit null elements, and some have restrictions on the types of their elements. Attempting to add an
 * ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically NullPointerException or ClassCastException. Attempting to query
 * the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception, or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit
 * the former behavior and some will exhibit the latter. More generally, attempting an operation on an ineligible element whose
 * completion would not result in the insertion of an ineligible element into the collection may throw an exception or it may succeed,
 * at the option of the implementation. Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this interface.
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the <i>adapter package</i>.
